# Notes:

Starting from the the sandbox: [Starting Point - CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/keeper-part-3-starting-s13gn?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)      
We click on the "Add Dependency Button" and serch for Material UI     
We need:
* @material Ui/core 
* @material Ui/icons

Installing Material UI:
* CodeSandbox: "Add Dependencies" Button > [@material Ui/core](https://codesandbox.io/examples/package/@material-ui/core)  
* Locally - NPM:  [Material UI - core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core)  

### Material UI
Material-UI are basically pre-built React Components that we can customize and get hold of some of the functionality     
so that we can create our own apps much faster using Google's design concept which is called Material Design.

#### Material UI - Icons
After installing Material UI core & icons,    
we can just import the icons and use them as any other React Component
